# AnnoyingCatScratch_Homework
Created an annoying game in Scratch. Its really terrible, don't play it for too long!

Game description:

You have to catch the hoooman as a cat.

If you succeed, the cat will say "Hello.", and the hoooman will fray the cat from himself.

Disclaimer: Because of the scratch very slow checking (forever cycle), its annoying to catch the hoomaaaan.
